Today I worked on:

Today I worked on:
Using react, I was able to get a drop down menu feature for the nav bar to work(right now it just has hard coded 
options, like about us, home, and contact). Actual links will be added into the drop down menu once more CRUD end points are created. CSS work is still required but will focus more on that after back end is more complete.

Today I worked on:

Got a 3-picture slideshow feature to work using react. Added an auto slide feature to it and using hard coded picture links(for now, until we can get some more knowledge on how to pull pictures from yelp or google APIs).
Plans for slideshow feature: Once we can pull data from yelp/google API, we want to have the slideshow automatically update with "Whats Hot/Trending" pictures. CSS work is still required but will focus more on that after backend is more complete.

Also added a Dark Mode feature with a toggle button to front end. As of now, Dark mode activated changes background to a dark gray color and Dark mode deactivated changes background back to white. Will come back to this feature later to change up CSS code so the dark mode is more presentable. Currently, Dark Mode deactivated just displays the white background we're going for...for now. 

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Ideas for Dark Mode toggle feature(STRETCH GOALS): 
Change up the idea from being a Dark Mode toggle to a Festive Mode feature. 
What do you mean?: When Festive mode toggle is clicked, the web site will turn into a holiday theme(christmas/halloween/valentines/etc.). 
When Festive Mode is activated, Website's contents will have CSS decorations for the upcoming holiday.

Today I worked on: 

Got clickable links to function on drop down menu(nav bar) using routes and navlinks. 
Started working on more aesthetics of the slideshow, getting the previous and next buttons to be transparent using bootstrap and also have it functioning. Currently dealing with the bootstrap buttons somehow overlapping the whole left and right side of the web page so the drop down menu isnt accessable. 


Jan 12th:

Today I worked on:

Fixed a weird bootstrap error where the slideshow button was being clickable from a large area(from top to bottom of both sides of the webpage). Used CSS to override the under the hood styles from the bootstrap code used in slideshow buttons. 

Changed dark mode button slider to have 2 different pictures, one day time themed and one night time themed. when clicking on the slider/button, a slide animation is presented with a fade in/fade out effect. 

Tore down placeholder styles for drop down menu aesthetics in preparation for next day's workload.


Jan 13th:

Today I worked on:

Built nav dropdown menu from an empty css file. Was able to get it to look how I want for now, most likely will come back to this and pretty up the actual button. Started working on event form. Had to duplicate the eventform.js file because having an event form on the main page and on the dropdown menu wasnt allowing me to change the cosmetics of one event form without the other changing.


tuesday to-do's:

Once logged in, need nav to not show login and signup
when not logged in, need logout to not show
