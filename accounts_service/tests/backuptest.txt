The unit test is checking that the get_all_accounts method in the AccountQueries class is working correctly.
Specifically, it tests that the method "get all accounts" in "AccountQueries" is working correctly by checking to see
if it returns a list of AccountOut objects. (Where each account object should have the following properties: id, username, email.)


The test starts by creating an instance of the AccountQueries class, then calls the get_all_accounts method.
This assigns the the return value as the accounts variable.

Then it asserts that the return value is a list and that each element of that list is an instance of AccountOut with
its respective properties.

The test checks that the method returns the correct type of object and has the correct properties.

Key take-away: If get_all_accounts isn't working properly, it could cause other issues in my code that rely on this endpoint.
At this point, there isnt a feature on our app that would need to make a request to this endpoint yet but could easily be one
when dealing with other microservices.
